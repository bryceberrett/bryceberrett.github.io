<p>Natural disasters have always been a tragic part of human history. Ignorance and a lack of due attention to this problem has caused incalculable damage and loss of life to hundreds of thousands across the world. 
With growing technology and understanding of natural disasters, we are now equiped with the tools to better prepare and mitigate against damage and loss of life. However, as our population grows exponentially bigger
and our population centers more consentrated, risk from natural disasters also increases. An earthquake event in San Francisco during the gold rush era vs today would exponentially raise the number of casualties and damage
sustained. ELCPA was designed so that those in harm's way for various geospatial and evacuation sensitive disasters can know the safest and quickest way to get to safety.
Events such as tsunamis and floods are prime examples of such disasters that can be planned for using this tool.</p>
